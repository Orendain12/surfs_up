**Summary**


In closing, Oahu is a fine location for the surf-and-ice cream shop to launch. The weather between June and Dec months vary so insignificantly based on min, max, mean temperatures. Tourist will be lining up for ice cream. 
In terms of additional analysis and collecting more data, below are several ideas

•	Hours of operation, would be based off of sunlight per day. The time of year month wise could contribute to successful   
hours of operations  
  
•	Running a precipitation query for June and Dec would provide clearer picture of overall weather pattern

•	Histogram plot form June and Dec – provide frequency of temperature. See diagrams below.
